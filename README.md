# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Classification with Naive Bayes 🩺

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a **Breast Cancer Tumor Classifier** using a simple **Naive Bayes (NB)** machine learning algorithm. The goal is to predict whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on features from a popular breast cancer dataset.

The model is built using **Scikit-learn** in Python, offering a straightforward implementation that can help medical professionals make more informed decisions by predicting the nature of a tumor.

    bash
    Copier le code
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classifier.git
    
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    cd breast-cancer-classifier
    
    ```
    
3. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```bash

## 🧠 Model Overview

The Naive Bayes classifier uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**, which contains several features related to tumor characteristics, including:

- **Radius** (mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter)
- **Texture** (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**
- **Smoothness**
- **Compactness**
- **Concavity**
- **Concave Points**
- **Symmetry**
- **Fractal Dimension**

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with the model learning from the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## 🔍 Example

1. Run the `breast_cancer_classifier.py` script.
2. The program will output the following metrics based on the test set:
    - **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions were correct.
    - **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
    - **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
    - **F1-Score**: A combination of precision and recall.
